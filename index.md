## About Me

I am a second-year PhD student of Transportation Engineering at McGill University. I received my master degree in Automation from Beihang University, and earned a Bachelor degree in Sichuan University. My current research centers on anomaly detection in spatiotemporal traffic data by low rank decomposition.

I am a big sports enthusiast. I love mannnnnny sports, especailly running, hiking and badminton. Yuzuru Hanyu is my Prince Charming :) I am also study Chinese musical instrument Guzheng for many years. Sports and music are vital parts of my life.

Now, I am doing handmade crafts, (e.g., embroidery, weave) to release stress and achieve my inner peace.
