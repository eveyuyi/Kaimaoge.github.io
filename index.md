## About Me

I am now a Postdoctoral Researcher with [Dr. Lijun Sun's group](https://lijunsun.github.io/) in the Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics of McGiil University. I received the Ph.D. degree in vehicle operation engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in Jun. 2019. My Ph.D. advisors were [Prof. Huachun Tan](https://tc.seu.edu.cn/2019/1022/c25722a291907/page.htm) and [Prof.Hongwen He](http://me.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jlgcx/ddjlgcjzzx/bssds4/26210.htm), who greatly helped me during my study at Bit. I was a visiting PhD student with Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, from Nov. 2016 to Dec. 2017. During this time, I was doing research on connected & autmated vehicles with [Prof. Bin Ran](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/cee/faculty/ran_bin). My research has focused on various machine learning technologies, e.g., tensor decomposition, graph neural networks, deep reinforcement learning, with the aim to facilitate the applications on intelligent transportation systems. My goal is to improve the efficiency, environmental-friendness and safety of transportation system via data-driven approaches. The novel applications in transportation engineering will also be explored to provide new insights into machine learning methods.
