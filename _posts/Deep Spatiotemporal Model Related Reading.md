# Deep ST Models

This is [my](https://Kaimaoge.github.io/) paper reading list about deep learning for spatiotemporal datasets. I will have preference on graph neural networks and temporal point process.I will update it once I find something intersting.

## General-review-gnn

I am learning a recent book written by William L. Hamilton 

- [Graph Representation Learning Book](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/grl_book/)

Two survey papers that I always referred to

IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9046288&casa_token=VAeauroZgfoAAAAA:sR2hwdE8mD-Va_sWmPLWE2S-5zXSVVUHEnmNsXE6Mqblcs2t8ZDAlj6-jXHx4bpKPErrXN-D&tag=1)

## Gnn-st-prediction

Those works are mainly concentrated on traffic forecasting. Traffic forecasting is a typical graph signal forecasting problem, so graph neural networks are suitable for capturing the spatial dependencies of traffic data.

## Inductive-gnn

Inductive learning setting can make the learned model adaptive to new/unseen sensors
