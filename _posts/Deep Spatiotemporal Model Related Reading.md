# Deep ST Models

This is [my](https://Kaimaoge.github.io/) paper reading list about deep learning for spatiotemporal datasets. I will have preference on graph neural networks and temporal point process.I will update it once I find something intersting.

A recent book written by William L. Hamilton I am learning

Two survey papers that I always referred to
