### Deep Spatiotemporal Modeling 

Large volumes of spatiotemporal data are increasingly collected and studied in modern transportation systems. Spatiotemporal models for traffic data are critical components of a wide range of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), such as ride sharing, transit service scheduling, signal control, and disruption management. The spatiotemporal data exhibit complex attributes, which introduce numerous challenges needs to be dealt with. Despite the abundance of spatiotemporal modeling techniques developed in different domains, it is still an open issue of making full use of the characteristics of the spatiotemporal datasets. The goal of this project is to develop new spatiotemporal models for urban traffic data based on deep learning and tensor learning. The specific objectives of this project are to: (1) characterize the spatiotemporal propagation properties of traffic data by deep spatiotemporal neural networks; (2) decouple interaction between external factors and traffic pattern by disentangle representation; (3) capture the strong regularity in collective travel behavior by low-rank tensor factorization and (4) utilize the cross-variable relationship by deep factors models. We will apply our models to large-scale and multivariate spatiotemporal data imputation and prediction.

### Reinforcement Learning for Intelligent Freeway Control

Cooperative intelligent freeway traffic control is an important application in intelligent transportation systems, which is expected to improve the mobility of freeway networks. We study how to achieve a cooperative control scheme of various traffic control strategies including ramp metering, differential variable speed limits and autonomous vehicle planning for improving traffic. However, the coordination of different traffic control approaches within one DRL framework is not an easy task. The first challenge is due to the difference between the control cycle of different agents. The second challenge stems from the difficulties in defining a representative reward signal for different traffic control agents. The third challenge lies in the modeling of the traffic state. We will explore a multi-agent learning based framework to handle those challenges.

### Learning-based Energy Management 

Fossil Fuel, as the main energy source for the vast majority of transportation, is unfortunately the main consumer of energy as well as pollutant of environment. The combination usage of fossil fuel and eco friendly energy sources is a lucrative solution to this problem. Efficient energy management of hybrid energy transportation is challenging owning to its enormous search space, multitudinous control variables and complicated driving conditions. In recent years, the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) – reinforcement learning models equipped with deep neural networks have made it possible for agents to achieve high-level control for very complex problems such as Go and StarCraft.The goal of this research is to develop nove DRL agents for hybrid energy transportation, and achieve a more eco-friendly and fuel-economical transportation systems.
